🚀 **Rewriting Quantum Measurement through Entropy-Aware Collapse**

</div>

### 🧠 What is QuantumEntropyX?

**QuantumEntropyX** is a research-driven project focused on developing and validating entropy-based mechanisms for quantum collapse, measurement, and information dynamics. This includes novel contributions such as:

- 🧬 **PDQC** – *Probability-Driven Quantum Collapse*, a model predicting entropy-biased deviations from the Born rule.
- 🪞 **QME** – *Quantum Mirror Effect*, a reflection-based reinterpretation of entangled state evolution.
- 🔐 **EB-QKD** – *Entropy-Based Quantum Key Distribution* for secure, entropy-aware cryptographic protocols.
- 🌀 **EWCL** – *Entropy-Weighted Collapse Law*, applied to proteins and quantum systems for structure prediction and decoherence modeling.
- 📊 **QWI-PI²** – Collapse detection and entropy-bias quantification metric used for training bias classifiers.
